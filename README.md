# CPARNA: A Statistical Framework for Cancer Phylogenetic Analysis based on RNA-seq Data

**CPARNA** is a new statistical framework for biologically interpretable cancer
phylogenetic analysis based on bulk RNA-seq data. We first use a nonparametric Bayesian method
to reconstruct the evolutionary history and population frequency of the subclonal lineages of a tumor.
We then propose a method to identify the distinct pathway alterations in each subclone and delineate
the temporal order of pathway alterations in tumor development for every single patient. Finally, cancer
subtypes are identified by clustering tumors with the similar evolutionary process of pathways. Our method
is demonstrated by both simulations and real data analysis.
